A web-based platform designed to streamline ABET accreditation processes across engineering programs.
ADMS centralizes Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs), Student Outcomes (SOs), assessment data, evidence uploads, and automated report generation, all within a secure, scalable, cloud-ready architecture.
